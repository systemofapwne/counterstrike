# My CS2 settings & scripts
These are my recent CS2 settings. Migrated from CS1.6 -> CS:GO -> CS2, refined to my needs over years and recently massivly strapped down for CS2.

All configurations like binds are directly in the autoexec, so I can rely on a coherent key setup across machines.

Note: I am using arrow keys for movement and numpad for weapon switching. This dates back more than 20 years and it is hard to drop old habits (I will never get comfortable with WASD!)
